:summary: How to connect to a TypeDB Cloud deployment.
:experimental:

TypeDB Cloud deployment is a cluster of TypeDB Enterprise servers.
As such it can receive connections from xref:clients::clients.adoc[TypeDB Clients]:

* TypeDB Studio
* TypeDB Console
* TypeDB Drivers:
** Java
** Python
** Node.js

To connect to a TypeDB Cloud deployment we need the following information:

* *Address* of any server in the deployment:
** Ip-address or domain name -- generated for every server in a deployment upon creation.
** Port number that the server is configured to listen to -- by default it's `1729`.
* *Credentials* of any user to authenticate on the server:
** Username -- by default it's `admin`.
** Password -- by default it's `password`.

////
* Whether the encryption is enabled or not.
** If the encryption is enabled - whether to use the default certificate or a custom one.
////
[IMPORTANT]
====
Connection to a TypeDB Enterprise server requires valid credentials of a user existing on that server.

It is not the same user as the user on TypeDB Cloud web portal that created or has access to the deployment.
====

To get the *address* of the server in a deployment use the following steps:

* Open the xref:deployments/life-cycle.adoc#_details[deployment details] page.
* Find the `Address` column in the table in the `Machines` section.

We can change the *credentials* with:

* xref:clients::console.adoc[TypeDB Console]
* Driver API:
** xref:clients::java/java-api-ref.adoc#_set_a_users_password[Java]
** xref:clients::python/python-api-ref.adoc#_set_a_users_password[Python]
** xref:clients::node-js/node-js-api-ref.adoc#_set_a_users_password[Node.js]

To connect to a TypeDB Cloud deployment with TypeDB Studio we can use the
xref:clients::studio.adoc#_connect_to_typedb_server[basic connection guide], but we need to select the TypeDB Cluster
option in the drop-down menu at the Connect to TypeDB window. That will display additional options to set addresses for
multiple servers in a cluster, username, password, and TLS encryption switch.

Use the btn:[Manage cluster addresses] button to set the address of a server to connect.

image::studio-manage-cluster-address.png[Connect to Studio window, width = 70%, link=self]

Insert the TypeDB Cloud deployment server address (including the port number, for example, `127.0.0.1:1729` or rather
`a242676f5710e462e9eed7a78d795ecb-1969767772.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:1729`) to the text field and press
the btn:[Add] button.

pages.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ideally, we want to use all servers of the deployments cluster to connect to in a TypeDB Client.

But if we set the address for only one server, upon connection, TypeDB Client will get information
of all servers in the cluster.
====

==  What to do next?

Upon successful connection to a server in a TypeDB Cloud deployment we can use the TypeDB Client we have used
to send some xref:typedb::fundamentals/queries.adoc[queries] to the server.

For example, complete our xref:typedb::quickstart.adoc[] with TypeDB Cloud deployment.

For more information, see the:

* xref:typedb::overview.adoc[TypeDB documentation] for general understanding of how to use TypeDB server,
* xref:clients::clients.adoc[TypeDB Clients documentation] for information on how to use Driver API methods,
TypeDB Studio GUI, or TypeDB Console CLI,
* xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL documentation] for advanced understanding of how to build a query and use patterns.
