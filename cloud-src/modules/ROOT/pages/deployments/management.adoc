A TypeDB Cloud deployment is a TypeDB Enterprise cluster that TypeDB Cloud manages.

A deployment can be created and destroyed in the TypeDB Cloud. While it exists, it can be suspended and resumed.

Most of the deployment life-cycle functions are available from the Deployments page.

The page includes a list of the deployments in the currency active organization that the current user can access.

The list has some built-in functions:

* filtering
* sorting
* pagination
