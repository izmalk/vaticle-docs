= Delete query
:experimental:
:tabs-sync-option:

A Delete query is used to delete data from a TypeDB database.

This page assumes you've already followed instructions from the xref:manual::writing/insert.adoc[] page.
Here, you'll see how to delete data from a database using Studio, Console, or one of the drivers.

== How to send a Delete query

The easiest way to send a Delete query is to use one of the TypeDB clients:
xref:manual::studio.adoc[Studio] or xref:manual::console.adoc[Console]:

[tabs]
====
Studio::
+
--
Follow the xref:manual::studio.adoc#_prepare_a_query[Studio manual]
to connect to TypeDB and select a project folder.
Then use the steps below:

. Use a drop-down list in the top toolbar to select a database with the name `sample_db`.
. Switch to `data` session and `write` transaction types.
. Open a new tab and insert or type in a Delete query, for example:
+
.TypeQL Delete query
[,typeql]
----
match
$u1 isa user, has name "Bob";
$u2 isa user, has name "Charlie";
$f($u1,$u2) isa friendship;
delete
$f isa friendship;
----
. Run the query by clicking the btn:[Run query] button (image:home::studio-icons/run.png[run]).
. Commit the changes by clicking the btn:[Commit query] button (image:home::studio-icons/commit.png[Commit]).
--

Console::
+
--
. Open a session and transaction:
+
[,bash]
----
transaction sample_db schema write
----
. Send the Define query:
+
[,bash]
----
match
$u1 isa user, has name "Bob";
$u2 isa user, has name "Charlie";
$f($u1,$u2) isa friendship;
delete
$f isa friendship;
----
+
Push btn:[Enter] twice to send the query.
. Commit the changes:
+
[,bash]
----
commit
----
--
====

To send a Define query programmatically, use xref:manual::installing/drivers.adoc[drivers]:

//#todo Check all the code
[tabs]
====
Rust::
+
--
[,rust]
----
let query = "match
$u1 isa user, has name "Bob";
$u2 isa user, has name "Charlie";
$f($u1,$u2) isa friendship;
delete
$f isa friendship;";
let databases = DatabaseManager::new(driver);
let db = databases.get("sample_db")?;
let session = Session::new(db, SessionType::Data)?;
let tx = session.transaction(TransactionType::Write)?;
tx.query().insert(&query)?;
tx.commit().resolve()?;

with driver.session("sample_db", SessionType.DATA) as session:
    with session.transaction(TransactionType.WRITE) as transaction:
        transaction.query.insert("insert $u isa user, has name 'Alice', has email 'alice@vaticle.com';")
        transaction.commit()

    try (TypeDBTransaction Transaction = session.transaction(TypeDBTransaction.Type.WRITE)) {

== Response interpretation

A Delete query returns a Promise of an empty response.
This promise can be resolved when the query is finished executing,
but it doesn't contain any useful information.

A `delete` clause is executed once per every result matched by the `match` clause of the same Delete query.

You can estimate the number of deletes in a Delete query
by running a dedicated Fetch or Get query with the same `match` clause in the same transaction.
Read queries can be used in a `write` transaction, and `write` transactions are snapshoted,
preventing data changes from other transactions from influencing the results.

=== Estimate the number of deletes with a read query

The most direct approach is to send an aggregated Get query to count the number of matches.

.Checking the number of matched results
[,typeql]
----
match
$u1 isa user, has name "Bob";
$u2 isa user, has name "Charlie";
$f($u1,$u2) isa friendship;
get; count;
----

The response should be a single number.
