= Programming concepts / Stateful objects / Stateful answers

TypeDB can retrieve data by projecting values to JSON objects.
Alternatively, you can get stateful objects from TypeDB either in response to a Get query or via API methods.

See below practical guides on how to use API methods to interact with types, rules, and data from a TypeDB database
without TypeQL queries.

Make sure to xref:home::install/overview.adoc[install] a client/driver to work with before proceeding.
