# Quickstart Guide

## An Overview

In this Quickstart guide, we go through step-by-step process of creating and interacting with a TypeDB database 
representing an [Identity and Access Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management) solution. This exact
database with both [schema](../../09-schema/00-overview.md) and [data](../../11-query/00-overview.md) is used in the 
most examples of the TypeDB documentation.

<div class="note">
[Important]
By completing this quickstart guide you will prepare an environment to successfully execute most requests explored 
in this documentation.
</div>

## Prerequisites

To proceed we need TypeDB and TypeDB Studio installed and ready. We can use the following guides to achieve that:

1. [Install TypeDB](02-installation.md)
2. [Install TypeDB Studio](../../02-clients/01-studio.md#download--install)

<div class="note">
[Important]
We need to use compatible versions of TypeDB and TypeDB Studio. Usually that means that version numbers should be 
similar.
</div>

## Prepare a Database

### First step: Launch TypeDB server

Launch the server by issuing command in terminal:

```bash
typedb server
```

After startup TypeDB server will show its logo and some technical output, including server version and server address. 

![TypeDB server launched](../../images/quickstart/quickstart-launched-typedb.png)

Note or copy the server address, we will connect to this address on the next step. By default, it's `0.0.0.0:1729`.

### Second step: Connect to a TypeDB server

Launch TypeDB Studio and at the top right-hand corner click `Connect to TypeDB` button.

![Connection Manager Disconnected](../../images/studio/connection-interface-disconnected.png)

At the Address field insert or type in the address of the TypeDB server. Press connect.

![Connection Manager Connected](../../images/studio/connection-interface-connected.png)

Now TypeDB Studio is connected to your TypeDB instance.

### Third step: Create a database

Let's create a new database. To do so, go to the databases manager by clicking on the database icon in the top left-hand 
corner. It is located directly left from the "Select Database" dropdown menu.

![Database Manager Empty](../../images/studio/studio-database.png)

In the database manager window locate single line input field at the bottom, type in `iam` and hit "Create".

![Database Manager With Phone Calls Database](../../images/studio/databases-interface-iam-database.png)

Now we've successfully created a database named `iam`!

### Fourth step: Prepare a Schema

A [TypeDB schema](../02-dev/05-schema.md) is the blueprint of a TypeDB database. 
We use [TypeQL](../../11-query) to define all concepts of a data model.

Studio will store queries you save in a project folder on you local machine, so you don't need to rewrite all your
queries each time you open Studio. To open a project folder click on the Open Folder icon in the top left corner or the 
Open Project button in the Project section on the left (under the database icon).

![Project Interface empty](../../images/quickstart/studio-projects-empty.png)

This is the project view. Here we see files and folders inside the selected Project folder. Unsaved queries saved in a 
hidden folder inside Project folder.

![Project Interface With Open Folder](../../images/studio/project-interface-created-folder.png)

To load a schema we can use one of the files in a project folder, or we can create one. To create a new request/file 
just click the plus (`+`) icon immediately right from the Project folder section tite. In the newly opened text editor 
on the right paste the following code of the IAM schema.

```typeql
define

subject sub entity,
    abstract,
    owns credential,
    plays group-membership:group-member,
    plays group-ownership:group-owner,

    owns review-date,
    owns validity;

    relates requesting-subject,
    relates requested-subject,
    relates requested-change;

    relates segregated-action,

rule add-view-access:
    when {
        $modify isa action, has name "modify_file";
        $view isa action, has name "view_file";
        $ac_modify (accessed-object: $obj, valid-action: $modify) isa access;
        $ac_view (accessed-object: $obj, valid-action: $view) isa access;
        (permitted-subject: $subj, permitted-access: $ac_modify) isa permission;
    } then {
        (permitted-subject: $subj, permitted-access: $ac_view) isa permission;
    };
    
```

### Fifth step: Load a Schema

To load a schema we need to execute our first transaction to the `iam` database. To do that correctly we need to make 
sure the session and transaction types are set to `schema` and `write` respectively. These can be found to the right of 
the database selector.

![Select transaction type](../../images/quickstart/studio-select-transaction-type.png)

Click the green play button to start the transaction. This will validate the request. If validation fails we will not 
be able to commit.

Finally, commit transaction by clicking the green tick immediately left from the play button. If we fail to commit the
changes will not be saved (persisted) in the database.

Now that `iam` database have a schema the Type browser will be populated with all the types from the databases schema.

![Types browser with IAM schema](../../images/quickstart/studio-types-browser-iam.png)

## Read a schema

To read a schema from TypeDB database we need to prepare query. We can use the following request to read full schema:

```typeql
match $s sub thing;
```

To execute that query we need to make sure the session and transaction types are set to `schema` and `read` 
respectively. Click the green play button to start the transaction. As a result by default we will see a graph 
visualization of the response data. In this case â€” graph of IAM schema.

![IAM schema graph](../../images/quickstart/studio-iam-schema.png)

## Insert data

Let's insert some test data into our `iam` database to be able to read it later.

Prepare the following query to load a miniature test dataset:

```typeql
# Subjects
insert $p isa person, has name "Masako Holley", has email "masako.holley@vaticle.com";  # No access
insert $p isa person, has name "Pearle Goodman", has email "pearle.goodman@vaticle.com";  # Sales manager

```

Make sure the session and transaction types are set to `data` and `write` respectively. Click the green play button to 
start the transaction. This will validate the request. If validation fails we will not be able to commit.

Finally, commit transaction by clicking the green tick immediately left from the play button. If we fail to commit the
changes will not be saved (persisted) in the database.

## Read data

To read data from TypeDB database we need to prepare query. We can use the following request to read all data in a 
database:

```typeql
match $t isa thing;
```

To execute that query we need to make sure the session and transaction types are set to `data` and `read`
respectively. Click the green play button to start the transaction. As a result by default we will see a graph
visualization of the response data. In this case â€” all our inserted data from the miniature dataset.
