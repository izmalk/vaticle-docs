[WARNING]
====
The `thing` internal type will be deprecated in one of the upcoming versions and deleted in TypeDB version `3.0`.

Consider using `entity`, `attribute`, or `relation` built-in types instead.

To produce the same result as the above example (except for the `thing` type), use the following query:

[,typeql]
----
match $s sub $t; {$t type entity;} or {$t type relation;} or {$t type attribute;};
