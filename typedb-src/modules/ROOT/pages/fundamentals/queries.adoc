All queries to a TypeDB database are written in TypeQL.

TypeQL is a *declarative* query language. For more information, see the xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL] section.

A top-level TypeQL construct is a query.

TypeQL query consists of clauses (one, two, or three).

A clause always starts with a keyword that defines the type of clause.

[#_define_query]
== Define query

A Define query is used to define types and rules in the schema.

A Define query consists of a single `define` clause.

For more information on the Define query, see the
xref:typeql::schema/define-types.adoc#_define_query[Define types] and
xref:typeql::schema/define-rules.adoc[] pages.

For examples of how to perform a Define query, see the xref:typedb::development/schema.adoc[] page.

[#_define_clause]
=== Define clause

A `define` clause adds the concepts and the constraints, described by its pattern, to the schema of the current
database.

A `define` clause is used only in the Define query.

A `define` clause has the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
define <pattern>
----

A pattern used in the `define` clause is limited to xref:typeql::schema/define-types.adoc[defining types] and
xref:typeql::schema/define-rules.adoc[rules]: the DDL part of the TypeQL.

[#_undefine_query]
== Undefine query

An `undefine` clause removes the concepts, the constraints, and the rules described by its pattern, from the schema
of the current database.

An Undefine query consists of a single `undefine` clause.

For more information on the Undefine query, see the
xref:typeql::schema/modify.adoc#_undefine_a_type[Modify existing schema] page.

For examples of how to perform an Undefine query, see the
xref:typedb::development/schema.adoc#_undefine[Defining schema] page.

[#_undefine_clause]
=== Undefine clause

An `undefine` clause is used only in the Undefine query.

An `undefine` clause has the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
undefine <pattern>
----

A pattern used in the `undefine` clause is xref:typeql::schema/modify.adoc[limited] to the DDL part of the TypeQL.

[#_get_query]
== Get query

A Get query is used to retrieve data from the TypeDB database. But it can also be used to retrieve types from the
TypeDB database schema.

A Get query consists of a `match` clause and an *optional* `get` clause.

A Get query returns a stream of results (with any number of results: from zero to many).

[NOTE]
====
Get queries were previously known as Match queries.

The old naming can be seen in some Driver API methods for backward compatibility.
====

For more information on the Get query, see the xref:typeql::data/get.adoc[] page in the
xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL] documentation.

For examples of how to perform a Get query, see the xref:typedb::development/read.adoc[] page.

[#_match]
=== Match clause

A `match` clause is one of the most important. It’s used to find data and types in the TypeDB database for later use
in the consequent clause of the same query.

By default, if no other clause is provided after the `match` clause it will retrieve all matched concepts (data and/or
types) as per the Get query behavior.

A `match` clause is widely used in different types of queries:

* <<_get_query,Get query>>
* <<_insert_query,Insert query>> (the `match` clause is optional)
* <<_delete_query,Delete query>>
* <<_update_query,Update query>>

A `match` clause has the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
match <pattern>
----

.See the match clause example
[%collapsible]
====
[,typeql]
----
match $p isa person, has full-name $f;
----
====

A pattern used in the `match` clause can address both types and data instances.
See the xref:typedb::fundamentals/patterns.adoc[] page for more information.

[#_get_clause]
=== Get clause

A `get` clause serves as a filter for matched concepts from a `match` clause to be retrieved in a Get query.

A `get` clause is optional in a Get query.

A `get` clause has the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
[get <variable> [(, <variable>)...];]
[modifiers]
----

.See the get clause example
[%collapsible]
====
[,typeql]
----
get $p, $f;
----
====

The variable or variables mentioned in a `get` clause must be bound (set) in the `match` clause of the same query.

A Get query with a `get` clause returns its results filtered -- only variables mentioned in the `get` clause are
returned. Every result has a concept or a value for any variable mentioned in the `get` clause.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A Get query without the `get` clause returns all variables mentioned in the `match` clause.
====

[#_modifiers]
==== Modifiers

Optionally, a `get` clause can have modifiers added after the list of variables.

Those modifiers can drastically change the output of the Get query:

* xref:typeql::data/get.adoc#_sort_the_answers[sort] -- sorting the results by a variable;
* xref:typeql::data/get.adoc#_offset_the_answers[offset] + xref:typeql::data/get.adoc#_limit_the_results[limit] --
  used for pagination of results;
* xref:typeql::data/get.adoc#_group[group] -- grouping results by a variable;
* xref:typeql::data/get.adoc#_aggregation[aggregation] -- process the results to produce a value for an answer.
// count | sum,max,min,mean,median,std <var>

[#_insert_query]
== Insert query

An Insert query is used to add data to the TypeDB database.

An Insert query consists of an *optional* `match` clause and an `insert` clause.

The optional xref:typedb::fundamentals/queries.adoc#_match[`match`] clause uses a
xref:typedb::fundamentals/patterns.adoc#_patterns_overview[pattern]
to find existing data which is needed as a context to insert new data. If no context is required (no existing data
to link with the inserted data) -- there is no need for a `match` clause in this query.

The xref:typedb::fundamentals/queries.adoc#_insert[`insert`] clause uses a pattern to specify the data to be inserted
and may include references to the existing data found by the optional `match` clause.

For example, to insert a new relation instance, we need to match every instance that will play a role in it to be
able to address them in the `insert` clause.

An Insert query returns a stream of inserted concepts (with any number of results: from zero to many).

The `insert` clause will be executed exactly once for every matched pattern found by the `match` clause. If the `match`
clause is omitted the `insert` query will be executed exactly once.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If there are no matches for a `match` clause in an `insert` query, then there will be no inserts.
====

The `insert` clause can have a pattern with multiple statements to insert in one query. But it can't insert types
(use xref:typedb::development/schema.adoc#_define_types[define] to insert new types) and can't have the following:

- Conjunction
- Disjunction
- Negation
- `is` keyword

For more information on the Insert query, see the xref:typeql::data/insert.adoc[] page in the
xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL] documentation.

For examples of how to perform an Insert query, see the xref:typedb::development/write.adoc#_insert[Insert query] section of the
xref:typedb::development/write.adoc[] page.

=== Match clause

See the <<_match>> section above.

[#_insert]
=== Insert clause

An `insert` clause is used to add new data to a database.

If the inserted data is somehow connected to the data existing in the database, we need to use the `match` clause
before the `insert` clause in the same Insert query.

An `insert` clause has the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
insert <pattern>
----

.See the insert clause example
[%collapsible]
====
[,typeql]
----
insert $p has email "email@vaticle.com";
----

The above example requires a preceding `match` clause to bind the `$p` variable. For example, to match some
`person` type instances first, to insert the email ownership only for them.

Alternatively, we can use insert query without a `match` clause, like that:

[,typeql]
----
insert $p isa person, has email "email@vaticle.com";
----

This version doesn't require a `match` clause, because it binds the only variable it has to a `person` type.
It creates a new instance of the `person` type in a database, before inserting an ownership of the email for the
instance.
====

A pattern used in an `insert` clause can use the variables from the preceding `match` clause.
See the xref:typedb::fundamentals/patterns.adoc[] page for more information.

[#_delete_query]
== Delete query

A Delete query is used to remove data from the TypeDB database.

A Delete query consists of a `match` clause and a `delete` clause.

A `match` clause uses a xref:typedb::fundamentals/patterns.adoc#_patterns_overview[pattern] to find existing
data/references which may be removed. To delete existing data, we need to find it first.

A `delete` clause uses a pattern to specify precisely the data to be removed.

For example, to remove ownership of an attribute without deleting the attribute itself.
Or, to remove the player of a role from a relation without deleting either the player or the relation/role.

The deletion pattern is executed exactly once for every result matched by the `match` clause.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If there are no matches for a `match` clause in a `delete` query, then there will be no deletes.
====

The `delete` clause can have a pattern with multiple statements to delete in one query. But it can't delete types (use
xref:typedb::development/schema.adoc#_undefine_types[undefine] to delete types) and can't have the following:

- Conjunction
- Disjunction
- Negation
- `is` keyword

For more information on the Delete query, see the xref:typeql::data/delete.adoc[Delete] page in the
xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL] documentation.

For examples of how to perform a Delete query, see the xref:typedb::development/write.adoc#_delete_query[Delete query] section of the
xref:typedb::development/write.adoc[] page.

=== Match clause

See the <<_match>> section above.

[#_delete]
=== Delete clause

A `delete` clause is used to delete data from a database.

A `delete` clause has the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
delete <pattern>
----

.See the delete clause example
[%collapsible]
====
[,typeql]
----
delete $p has email $e;
----
====

A pattern used in a `delete` clause must use the variables from the preceding `match` clause.
See the xref:typedb::fundamentals/patterns.adoc[Patterns] page for more information.

[#_update_query]
== Update query

An Update query removes data from the TypeDB database and then inserts new data instead.

An Update query consists of a `match` clause, a `delete` clause, and an `insert` clause.

A `match` clause uses xref:typedb::fundamentals/patterns.adoc[patterns] to find existing data/references to be changed.
To delete existing data, we need to find it first.

A `delete` clause is used to precisely select what to delete with a pattern. The deletion pattern is executed exactly
once for every result matched by the `match` clause.

An `insert` clause is used to insert new data after the deletion of the old one. The insertion pattern is executed
exactly once for every result matched by the `match` clause.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If there are no matches for a `match` clause in an update (`match-delete-insert`) query, then there will be no
deletes and no inserts.
====

The `delete` clause can have a pattern with multiple statements to delete in one query. But it can't delete types (use
xref:typedb::fundamentals/queries.adoc#_undefine_query[undefine] to delete types) and can't have the following:

- Conjunction
- Disjunction
- Negation
- `is` keyword

The `insert` clause can have a pattern with multiple statements to insert in one query. But it can't insert types (use
xref:typedb::fundamentals/queries.adoc#_define_query[define] to insert new types) and can't have the following:

- Conjunction
- Disjunction
- Negation
- `is` keyword

Unlike other databases, TypeDB does not update data in place. Data is updated by replacing references to it.
When we remove a player from a role in a relation, the player itself is not removed from the database, but rather the
information of it playing the role.

In addition, attributes are immutable. Rather than changing the value of an owned attribute,
the ownership of it is replaced with the ownership of a new/different attribute.

For more information on the Update query, see the xref:typeql::data/update.adoc[] page.

.See the update query example
[%collapsible]
====
[,typeql]
----
match
  $p isa person, has full-name $n;
  $n contains "inappropriate word";
delete
  $p has $n;
insert
  $p has full-name "deleted";
----

For every instance of `person` entity type with owned attribute of `full-name` type, which value contains
`inappropriate word` string, we delete the ownership of the attribute and insert an ownership of a new one with the
value of `deleted` to the same entity.
====

xref:typedb::development/write.adoc#_update_query[Update query]
section of the xref:typedb::development/write.adoc[] page.
