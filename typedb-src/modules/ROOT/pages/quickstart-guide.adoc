:tabs-sync-option:
:experimental:

This Quickstart guide shows how to set up a TypeDB database and execute queries with it.

== Prerequisites

[#_download_sample_data]
=== Download schema and data

For the purpose of this Quickstart guide, use the following files:

[#_iam_schema]
* xref:attachment$iam-schema.tql[iam-schema.tql] -- The TypeQL define query for the IAM schema.
[#_iam_microdataset]
* xref:attachment$iam-data.tql[iam-data.tql] -- TypeQL insert queries of minimalistic dataset for the IAM schema.

=== Install and run TypeDB

To proceed, please make sure you have TypeDB server (or cluster)
xref:installation.adoc#_install[installed,window=_blank] and
xref:installation.adoc#_start_the_server[running,window=_blank].

[#_typedb_client]
== Select a TypeDB Client to proceed

Choose either TypeDB Console (CLI) or TypeDB Studio (GUI) in the tabs below and complete all the steps.

We recommend familiarizing yourself with at least one of these two Clients, before trying to start developing with
your own application with language-specific TypeDB Drivers.

[tabs]
====
TypeDB Console::
+
--
TypeDB Console is a CLI TypeDB Client.

image::typedb::quickstart-console.png[TypeDB Console, width = 75%, link=self]

TypeDB Console is usually installed together with TypeDB server and in the same directory.

For more information on how to use it, see the xref:clients:ROOT:console.adoc[,window=_blank] page.
--
TypeDB Studio::
+
--
TypeDB Studio is a GUI TypeDB Client.

image::typedb::quickstart-studio.png[TypeDB Studio, width = 75%, link=self]

TypeDB Studio needs to be
xref:clients:ROOT:studio.adoc#_download_install[installed]
and launched separately from TypeDB.

For more information on how to use it, see the xref:clients:ROOT:studio.adoc[,window=_blank] page.
--
====

== Connect to TypeDB

[tabs]
====
TypeDB Console::
+
--
By default, TypeDB Console will try to connect to the default server address of `localhost:1729`.

.Server connection example
[,bash]
----
typedb console --server 127.0.0.1:1729
----

.Cluster connection example (TLS encryption enabled)
[,bash]
----
typedb console --cluster=i0.deployment-a4fa2444.cloud.typedb.com:1729 --username=admin --password --tls-enabled --tls-root-ca="/Users/username/typedb-cloud/typedb-cloud-root-ca.pem"
----

To exit TypeDB Console press kbd:[Ctrl+C].

[NOTE]
=====
The fastest way to go through all the steps is to use
xref:clients:ROOT:console.adoc#_non_interactive_mode[non-interactive]
mode by issuing the following commands directly in a local terminal (not in a TypeDB Console prompt).
=====
--
TypeDB Studio::
+
--
Connect to TypeDB:

. Click the btn:[Connect to TypeDB] button  on the right side of the toolbar.
. Enter TypeDB server address (e.g., `localhost:1729`) in the *Address* field and click the btn:[Connect] button.

1. Select `TypeDB Cluster` option in the *Server* field.
2. Click the btn:[Manage Cluster Addresses] button and add all known addresses for TypeDB servers on the cluster you
   are connecting.
3. Fill all other fields with appropriate information and click the btn:[Connect] button.

Select the folder with the <<_download_sample_data,downloaded TypeQL files>> as
xref:clients:ROOT:studio.adoc#_open_a_project_directory[project directory,window=_blank] by using one of the following
buttons:

* btn:[Open Project] button in the *Project* panel (upper left);
* btn:[Open Project Directory] button with a folder icon, leftmost on the top toolbar.
--
====

== Create a new database

[tabs]
====
TypeDB Console::
+
--
Use the following command in a local terminal:

[,bash]
----
typedb console --command="database create try-iam"
----
--
TypeDB Studio::
+
--

. Open the *Manage Databases* dialog by clicking the database icon on the left side of the toolbar.
+
image::studio-database.png[Database Manager button,width = 75%,link=self]
. Enter `try-iam` in the text field, and click the btn:[Create] button next to it.
. Now select `try-iam` from the database dropdown (next to the database icon).
--
====

[#_define_a_schema_from_a_file]
== Define a schema from a file

[tabs]
====
TypeDB Console::
+
--
Use the following command in a local terminal:

[,bash]
----
typedb console --command="transaction try-iam schema write" --command="source iam-schema.tql" --command="commit"
----
--
TypeDB Studio::
+
--
Open the xref:typedb::attachment$iam-schema.tql[iam-schema.tql,window=_blank] file from the project panel on the top left.

Define the schema for the database selected earlier, by executing the define query from the file:

. Ensure the btn:[Session type] (`schema` / `data`) is set to the `schema` and the
  btn:[Transaction type] (`write` / `read`) is set to the `write` in the toolbar.
. Execute the query by clicking the btn:[Run Query] button.
. Commit the changes in transaction by clicking the btn:[Commit Transaction] button.
--
====

Schema is defined. The database is ready to insert some data.

== Load data from a file

[tabs]
====
TypeDB Console::
+
--
Use the following command in a local terminal:

[,bash]
----
typedb console --command="transaction try-iam data write" --command="source iam-data.tql" --command="commit"
----
--
TypeDB Studio::
+
--
Open the xref:attachment$iam-data.tql[iam-data.tql] file from the project panel.

Load the data into the database selected earlier, by executing the insert queries from the file:

. Ensure the btn:[Session type] (`schema` / `data`) is set to the `data` and the btn:[Transaction type]
  (`write` / `read`) is set to the `write` in the toolbar.
. Execute all queries from the file by clicking the btn:[Run Query] button.
. Commit the changes in transaction by clicking the btn:[Commit Transaction] button.
--
====

The data is persisted in the database. The database is ready for queries.

[NOTE]
====
The IAM schema and data from this Quickstart guide are widely used in examples throughout the documentation.
====

== Simple examples

We have prepared a few query examples below:

* <<#_get_query__retrieve_all_data>>
* <<#_get_query__retrieve_all_schema_types>>
* <<#_get_query__get_all_emails_of_kevin>>
* <<#_insert_query__add_a_new_email_for_kevin>>
* <<#_update_query__change_the_newly_added_email_for_kevin>>
* <<#_delete_query__delete_ownership_of_the_newly_updated_email_from_kevin>>

////
// tag::thing_deprecation[]
[WARNING]
====
The `thing` internal type will be deprecated in one of the upcoming versions and deleted in TypeDB version `3.0`.

Consider using `entity`, `attribute`, or `relation` built-in types instead.

To produce the same result as the above example (except for the `thing` type), use the following query:

[,typeql]
----
match $s sub $t; {$t type entity;} or {$t type relation;} or {$t type attribute;};
----
====
// end::thing_deprecation[]
