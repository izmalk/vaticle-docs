:Summary: How to define a schema for a TypeDB database.

:pageTitle: Defining a schema
:experimental:

Before inserting any data into a database, we need to define its schema.
Schema consists of types and rules definitions.
For more information on types, see the xref:typedb::basics/data-model.adoc[data model] page.

== New schema

To define a schema for a new database, you can use a Define query, for example:

[#_example]
.Define query example
[,typeql]
----
define

email sub attribute, value string;
full-name sub attribute, value string;
user sub entity, owns email;
person sub user, owns full-name;
----

A Define query can be sent with any TypeDB client: TypeDB Studio, TypeDB Console, or language-specific drivers.
Select a TypeDB client below, and send the query example above, using the instructions provided below.

For more information on how to connect to TypeDB, open a session, and open a transaction, see the
xref:typedb::connecting/overview.adoc[] page.

[tabs]
====
Console::
+
--
. Connect to TypeDB.
. Open a `schema` session and `write` transaction to a new/empty database, for example:
+
[,bash]
----
transaction db1 schema write
----
. Copy-paste the <<_example,query example>> above and push btn:[Enter] *twice*.
. Commit the changes made in the transaction:
+
[,bash]
----
commit
----
--

Studio::
+
--
. xref:typedb::connecting/studio.adoc#_connect_to_typedb[Connect to TypeDB] and
xref:typedb::connecting/studio.adoc#_select_a_project_directory[select a project directory].
. Select a new/empty database from a drop-down list in the top toolbar next to the database icon
image:home::studio-icons/database.png[].
. Switch to the `schema` and `write` in the top toolbar's session and transaction type selectors.
. Create a new tab in TypeDB Studio text editor, copy-paste the <<_example,query example>> above.
. Execute the query by clicking on the btn:[Run Query] (image:home::studio-icons/run.png[]) button.
. Commit the changes with the btn:[Commit transaction] (image:home::studio-icons/commit.png[]) button.

[#_extend_a_schema]
== Extend a schema

Any schema can be extended by adding new types, new properties to existing types,
as well as adding new rules or replacing existing rules with just a Define query.

For more information on defining types and rules in a schema, see the
xref:typeql::schema/define-types.adoc[]
and xref:typeql::schema/define-rules.adoc[] pages.

[#_truncate_a_schema]
== Truncate a schema

Any schema can be truncated by removing existing types, their properties, and existing rules with an
xref:typeql::schema/undefine.adoc[Undefine query].

To remove a statement about a type from a schema, use it in an Undefine query.

.Undefine example
[,typeql]
----
undefine

full-name sub attribute;
----

The above example removes the `full-name` attribute type from a schema.
To be able to remove a type from a schema, that type must have neither a subtype defined in a schema,
nor data of that type inserted to a database.
Undefining a type also removes all references of the type in a schema in regard to ownerships and roles.
In the above example, statement `person owns full-name` also get removed from a schema.

For more information on how to undefine types, see the xref:typeql::schema/undefine.adoc[] page.

[#_undefine_subtype]
[IMPORTANT]
====
To be able to undefine a type, it needs to have no subtypes in a schema and no data in a database.
====

[#_undefine_rules]
=== Undefine rules

To undefine a rule, use the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
undefine

rule <rule-label>;
----

Undefining a rule does not require repeating its condition or conclusion.

== Delete a schema

You can remove all user-defined types and all rules.
But that also requires to delete all data from a database.
It is usually easier to just delete the whole database and create a new one with the same name.

== Rename a type

To rename a type, use the xref:typedb:ROOT:connecting/studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio] or TypeDB driver API methods.
//#todo Add tabs with code snippets and links to API ref?

== Modify a rule

You can replace a rule with a new one by xref:typeql::schema/define-rules.adoc[defining a new rule]
with the same label as the old one.

== Learn more

After you defined a schema, you can xref:typedb::developing/write.adoc[write] some data to the database.

If you don't have your own schema ready yet, feel free to continue using the
