= Deep dive in the Inference

[NOTE]
====
The approach TypeDB uses is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_chaining[backward-chaining,window=_blank]
execution on top of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause[Horn-clause,window=_blank] logic.

Negation functionality follows the set-difference semantics. It corresponds to negation-as-failure model under the
following conditions:

- We have stratified negation.
- The results are grounded.
- We ensure all variables occurring both inside and outside the negation are bound by the time the negation is
evaluated.

Infinite recursion and non-termination are prevented with a tabling mechanism.
