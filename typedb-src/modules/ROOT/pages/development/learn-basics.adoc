== TypeDB server and clients

=== Server

TypeDB is a server-side software, used to manage databases and process queries written in TypeQL.

//What is TypeDB
TypeDB: :: DBMS software with polymorphism, strong type system, fully declarative query language, and reasoning engine.

//TypeDB editions
TypeDB has three editions: TypeDB Cloud, TypeDB Enterprise, and TypeDB Core.
All editions support the same set of query types and the same TypeQL syntax.

For more information on differences between TypeDB editions,
see the https://typedb.com/deploy[Deploy] page of our website.

=== Clients

//client-server architecture
//client role
TypeDB uses https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-protocol[TypeDB protocol], based on https://grpc.io/[gRPC],
to communicate queries and responses.

TypeDB Client: :: Any software capable of communicating with TypeDB through the TypeDB protocol.

TypeDB Driver: :: A language-specific library that implements the TypeDB protocol and provides a TypeDB Driver API.

TypeDB Drivers are usually used to create other TypeDB Clients, including
xref:clients:ROOT:studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio,window=_blank] and
xref:clients:ROOT:console.adoc[TypeDB Console,window=_blank].

== Database

//database data separation
TypeDB stores data in databases.

Every database has a name and consists of schema and data.

For more information on how to create a database, see the xref:development/connect.adoc#_databases[Databases] section
on the xref:development/connect.adoc[] page.

//storage
//Physical persistent storage is implemented with https://www.speedb.io/[SpeedDB].

=== Schema
//schema

Schema: :: A database schema is a full set of definitions for all types and rules, used in the database.

Schema is like a blueprint of data in a database.

//types
Type: :: A template for creating a data instance.

A type is also a category for classification of data instances.
By defining a type, we define constraints for all instances of this type.

A type is like a class for an object in OOP programming languages.

A new type can be defined by subtyping an existing type.
Subtype inherits constraints and properties of its supertype.
Any type has exactly one supertype.

A brand-new database with an empty schema has built-in root types: `entity`, `relation`, and `attribute`.
All user-defined types in a schema are direct or indirect subtypes of these root types.

include::typeql:ROOT:fundamentals.adoc[tag=entity_type_definition]

include::typeql:ROOT:fundamentals.adoc[tag=relation_type_definition]

include::typeql:ROOT:fundamentals.adoc[tag=attribute_type_definition]

For more information on schema types, see the xref:typeql:ROOT:fundamentals.adoc#_types[Types] section on the
xref:typeql:ROOT:fundamentals.adoc[] page.

//rules
Rules represent logic embedded in a schema.
Rules are used by reasoning engine to infer new data, based on patterns, found in existing data.

For more information on rules, see the xref:typeql:ROOT:fundamentals.adoc#_rules[] section on the
xref:typeql:ROOT:fundamentals.adoc[] page.

=== Data
//Instance of a type

To insert any data in a TypeDB database, we instantiate a type, defined in a database's schema.

All inserted data should be compliant with constraints from a schema of a database it is inserted to.

Retrieving data from a database can result in getting values directly, but more often it includes dealing with concepts,
returned by a TypeDB Driver through Driver API.

//Concept
Concept: :: Either a type or an instance of a type.

TypeDB Driver API has methods to process concepts.

For more information on Driver API concept methods, see the relevant Driver API reference:

* xref:clients:ROOT:java/java-api-ref.adoc#_concept_methods[Java]
* xref:clients:ROOT:python/python-api-ref.adoc#_concept_methods[Python]
* xref:clients:ROOT:node-js/node-js-api-ref.adoc#_concept_methods[Node.js]

== Connection

//client
To send a query to TypeDB, we need to do the following:

. Establish a network connection between a TypeDB Client and a TypeDB server or a cluster.
. Open a session to a database.
. Open a transaction.

To establish a network connection, we need a server address, including the port that the server is listening to.
//For clusters (available in Enterprise and CLoud editions) we also need username, password, and CA certificate for TLS.
TypeDB usually uses a single connection to a single TypeDB server or cluster.

//session
//Without a session, we can establish a session, create a new database or delete an existing one.
To open a session, we need a database name and a session type: `schema` or `data`.

You can open more than one session to a database, but there are some limitations for the
xref:development/acid-guarantees.adoc#_schema_integrity[schema integrity].

For more information on how to open a session, see the xref:development/connect.adoc#_sessions[sessions]
section on the xref:development/connect.adoc[] page.

//transaction
//Without a transaction we can
To open a transaction, we need a transaction type: `read` or `write`.

You can open more than one transaction in a session, but transactions have a time limit of 5 minutes by default.

For more information on how to open a transaction, see the xref:development/connect.adoc#_transactions[transactions]
section on the xref:development/connect.adoc[] page.

== Query

All queries to a TypeDB database are written in TypeQL.

TypeQL is a *declarative* query language.

include::typeql:ROOT:queries.adoc[tag=queries_table]

For more information on query types, read the xref:typeql:ROOT:queries.adoc[] page.

There are different ways to send a query to a TypeDB database, depending on what TypeDB Client is used.

== Pattern matching

TypeDB xref:typeql:ROOT:fundamentals/queries.adoc[queries] are written in xref:typeql:ROOT:overview.adoc[TypeQL]
and use *patterns* to manipulate the schema and data of a database.

A pattern is a set of statements.
By default, conjunction combines all statements.
Disjunction and negation can be used explicitly.

=== Example

image::example-pattern.png[Complex example]

The pattern is a conjunction of five different pattern types:

. *Conjunction 1* specifies the variables for two `person` instances, their `full-names`, `action`, and `file` that
  has path `README.md`, specifies their types.
. *Disjunction* specifies that the actions of interest are either `modify_file` or `view_file`.
. *Negation 1* specifies that person `$p1` shall not have `full-name` with value of `Masako Holley`.
. *Negation 2* specifies that person `$p2` shall not have `full-name` with value of `Masako Holley`.
. *Conjunction 2* specifies that the `file` has `access` with the `action` that we specified earlier,
  and both instances of the `person` to have the `permission` to the specified `access`.

In short, the above example finds pairs of people who both have permission to access the same file
with a path of `README.md`. The pattern additionally specifies the access to be either `modify_file` or `view_file`,
and neither people to have the full-name `Masako Holley`.
