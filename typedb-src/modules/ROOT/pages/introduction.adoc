:summary: A birds-eye view of TypeDB.

TypeDB is a strongly typed database management system (DBMS) with an intelligent reasoning engine
to infer new data and a declarative query language based on composable patterns to find it easily.

== Short summary

TypeDB is a transactional (OLTP) DBMS with xref:development/acid-guarantees.adoc[] that is strongly-typed and
has the following features:

* TypeDB uses enhanced Entity-Relationship model, extended with Attributes as first-class citizens;
* TypeDB has its own special static type system, supporting user-defined types with subtyping and inheritance,
  like OOP languages;
* TypeDB can use rule-based logic embedded into a database schema to infer new data from patterns found in existing data;
* TypeDB uses its own declarative query language -- xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL].

The core of any TypeDB database is its schema.
A schema is a conceptual (logical) data model rather than a physical one and consists of types and rules.

Using xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL], we define a schema to model business domains true to life.

We build data queries using declarative and composable patterns, written in TypeQL, and types, defined in schema.

== Comparison with other databases
//#todo add direct comparison materials links

TypeDB looks beyond relational and NoSQL databases by introducing a strong type system and extending it with inference
and pattern matching for simple, yet powerful querying.

Some examples of what TypeDB is not:

* It’s not an SQL database, but it uses an enhanced Entity-Relationship model that is extended by attributes as
  first-class citizens;
* It’s not a graph database, but it utilizes the power of hypergraphs without asking developers to understand the
  implementation details;
* It’s not an object-oriented database, but it uses types with subtyping and inheritance to model data.

For more information on comparison with other types of databases, see the
https://typedb.com/introduction[Introduction to TypeDB] page of our website.

=== Strong type system

TypeDB brings the benefits of strong typing in modern programming languages to the database, allowing developers
to use abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism when modeling and querying data – and finally removing the mismatch
between logical and physical data models.

A strict hierarchy of types, expandable by adding new types. Every new type should be a subtype of exactly one
supertype -- either a built-in type or another user-defined type.

Any TypeDB database have the following built-in types:

* `entity` -- a root types for all entities. An entity represents a self-sufficient object.
* `relation` -- a root type for all relations. A relation represents n-ary relationship between other types.
* `attribute` -- a root type for all attributes. An attribute represents a property with a value.

An accurate type hierarchy can add context and constraints to data using strong typing and inheritance.

=== Rule inference

Rules represent logic embedded in a schema.
Inference is a logical deduction based on a set of rules defined in a schema.

When a READ type transactions are running with the _inference_ option enabled,
TypeDB can deduce new (virtual) attribute ownerships and relations, if they influence the query results.

Virtual (inferred) data is not persisted and will be lost upon closing the transaction.

.See rule examples
[%collapsible]
====
*Inferring new data*

[,typeql]
----
define

rule everyone-is-a-dude:
    when {
        $p isa person;
    } then {
        $p has full-name "Dude";
    };
----

The above example will add a `full-name` attribute with value `Dude` to every existing person.

*Transitive relations*

Let's add an ability for user-groups to be members of other user-groups to the schema we used above.

[,typeql]
----
define

user-group plays group-membership:member;
----

Now, we can add a new rule, to enable group membership being transitive, so we can include Group A into Group B,
so that every member of Group A, will become a member of Group B through transitivity of membership:

`person` -> Group A -> Group B.

[,typeql]
----
define

rule transitive-group-membership:
   when {
      (group: $g1, member: $g2) isa group-membership;
      (group: $g2, member: $p) isa group-membership;
   } then {
      (group: $g1, member: $p) isa group-membership;
   };
----

The above rule works for any number of groups.

For example, if we insert data of group-membership according to the following:

`person` -> Group A -> Group B -> Group C -> Group D -> Group E

where `->` -- means `group-membership` relation with entity on the left from -> playing role of `member`
and entity on the right playing the role of `group`. Then the transitivity, implemented by
the `transitive-group-memmbership` rule will make `person` a member of all groups from A to E.

For more information on rule inference, see the xref:typeql::schema/define-rules.adoc[] page
in xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL documentation].

=== Truly declarative and composable data queries

TypeQL is designed specifically for expressing what data looks like, not how to get it.
There are no joins, no unions and no need for ordered query logic.

Data queries based on powerful yet simple patterns, using types, defined in a schema of a database.
Those patterns are easily readable and composable. We can add new statements to ane place of a pattern,
even combine multiple patterns together, to retrieve all matching data in just one query.

.See data queries examples
[%collapsible]
====

The following insert query creates two instances of the `person` type, two groups and assigning a membership in one
of the groups for one of the users:

[,typeql]
----
insert
$p1 isa person,
    has full-name "Bob",
    has name "bob90",
    has email "bob@vaticle.com";

$p2 isa person,
    has full-name "Alex",
    has name "al-capucino";

$g1 isa user-group,
    has name "admins";

$g2 isa user-group,
    has name "users";

$m (member: $p1, group: $g1) isa group-membership;
----

The following query retrieves data of all instances of `user` type (which is a supertype for the `person` type) that
have ownership over any attributes and returns instances of all matched instances of `user` type or its subtypes and
with the attributes they own.

[,typeql]
----
match
$u isa user, has $a;
----

The following query executes `match` clause first and then `insert` clause using matched data.
The `match` clause matches all instances of `person` type and all instances of `group` type, owning an attribute of
type `name` and value `users` such as there is no `group-membership` relation between them.
Then the `insert` clause inserts a `group-membership` relation between all matched instances of `person`
and all matched instances of `group`:

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person;
$g isa user-group,
    has name "users";
not { ($p, $g) isa group-membership; };
insert
(member:$p, group:$g) isa group-membership;
