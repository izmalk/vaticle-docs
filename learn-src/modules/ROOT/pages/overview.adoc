= Course overview

Welcome to the TypeDB learning course. This course is designed as an end-to-end learning experience for TypeDB and TypeQL. Through the lens of a sample bookstore database, you'll learn how to build a database schema, manage data, and interpret query results.

== Required knowledge

This course is intended for:

* Users who are completely new to TypeDB.
* Users who have used TypeDB a bit and want to solidify their understanding.
* Users who have used TypeDB a lot and want to recap the fundamentals.

You will not need any prior knowledge of TypeDB in order to complete this course.

Some knowledge of databases and object-oriented programming is assumed. You do not need to be an expert on the following topics, but they should be familiar terms:

* Database basics: queries, transactions, CRUD operations, etc.
* OOP basics: types, objects, interfaces, etc.
* Architecture basics: server, client, API, etc.

If you would like to refresh your knowledge, we recommend the following resources:

== Course content

This course is arranged into several lessons covering key topics:

1. xref:learn::1-why-typedb/1-why-typedb.adoc[Why TypeDB]: Introduction to the data engineering challenges that served as the motivation for TypeDB, and how TypeDB solves them.
2. xref:learn::2-learning-environment-setup/2-learning-environment-setup.adoc[Learning environment setup]: Guide to setting up the environment for this learning course quickly and easily, complete with a sample database for a bookstore.
3. xref:learn::3-running-your-first-queries/3-running-your-first-queries.adoc[Running your first queries]: Some simple read queries to introduce TypeQL's basic syntax and the structure of query responses.
4. xref:learn::4-designing-schemas/4-designing-schemas.adoc[Designing schemas]: The schema design process broken down and explained, from conceptual PERA modeling to the TypeQL implementation.
5. xref:learn::5-pattern-based-querying/5-pattern-based-querying.adoc[Pattern-based querying]: Introduction to pattern matching, which forms the basis of all TypeQL queries for reading and writing data.
6. xref:learn::6-reading-data/6-reading-data.adoc[Reading data]: Complete guide to read queries, covering basic query structure, subqueries, aggregations, sorting, and pagination.
7. xref:learn::7-writing-data/7-writing-data.adoc[Writing data]: Complete guide to write queries, covering insert, delete, and update operations. Examines effects of schema constraints on inserted data.
8. xref:learn::8-reasoning-over-data/8-reasoning-over-data.adoc[Reasoning over data]: Introduction to using TypeDB's built-in symbolic reasoning engine to derive new data using rules defined in first-order logic.

The lessons are mostly self-contained but intended to be followed in order. If you already have experience with TypeDB, you may want to try skipping topics you feel confident on.
