= 4 - Designing schemas

In this lesson, we'll be exploring schema design in depth. We'll begin with *conceptual modeling* in terms of entities, relations, and attributes, and build a data model for a bookstore database. Afterward, we'll see how we can express the model in TypeQL, including the *inheritance hierarchies* and *interface implementations* necessary to model polymorphism. This will be broken down into several parts focussing on defining different parts of the model.
