= 3 - Running your first queries

In this lesson, we'll run a few simple queries to read data from the sample dataset in order to learn the basic syntax of TypeQL and the response format. The queries are shown alongside the equivalent SQL as a comparison. We'll first retrieve data associated with some *entities*, then data associated *relations*. We'll also see how *type inference* can play into queries. Finally, we'll retrieve the *types* of some data instances.
