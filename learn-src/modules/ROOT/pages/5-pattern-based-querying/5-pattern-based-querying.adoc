= 5 - Pattern-based querying

In this lesson, we'll learn how to construct the *patterns* that serve as the basis for all TypeQL data queries. To begin with, we'll explore what a pattern is and how we can represent it a set of *constraints*. Next, we'll see how to construct a full range of patterns, varying in complexity, including *polymorphic* patterns for declarative polymorphic queries. Finally, we'll explore how pattern semantics affects the number of results returned or writes performed.
