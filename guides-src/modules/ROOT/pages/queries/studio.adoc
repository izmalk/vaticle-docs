= Running queries with TypeDB Studio
:experimental:

This guide covers sending queries to TypeDB with TypeDB Studio.
TypeDB Studio should be xref:guides::installation/studio.adoc[installed] and
xref:guides::connection/studio.adoc[connected] to TypeDB Cloud/Core already.

To run a query with TypeDB Studio, use the following steps:

. Select a database from a drop-down list in the top toolbar next to the database icon
image:home::studio-icons/database.png[].
. Select the session (`schema`/`data`) and the transaction (`write`/`read`) types in the top toolbar.
. Open a query file or create a new tab in the text-editor panel and insert/type in a new TypeQL query.
. Execute a query by clicking on the btn:[Run Query] (image:home::studio-icons/run.png[]) button.
. For `write` transactions, commit the changes with the
btn:[Commit Transaction] (image:home::studio-icons/commit.png[]) button,
or close transaction without persisting changes with the btn:[Close Transaction]
(image:home::studio-icons/close.png[]).

The response from a query should appear at the bottom of the Studio window.

For TypeQL query examples, see the xref:home::25-queries.adoc[] page.
For more information on TypeQL query design and syntax, see the xref:typeql::schema/overview.adoc[] and
xref:typeql::data/overview.adoc[] pages in the TypeQL documentation.

[#_using_inference]
== Using inference

To use rule-based inference with TypeDB Studio, follow the steps below:
//#todo add inference details and examples links

. Make sure xref:typeql::schema/overview.adoc[rules are defined] in the schema.
. Switch to `data` session and `read` transaction types.
. Toggle on the `infer` button in the top toolbar.
. Run a query.

For a *Get query*, Studio visualizes results in the Graph output tab.
Results obtained by rule-based inference are highlighted with green color in Studio's graph visualizer.
To be able to explain inferred results, you need to enable <<_using_explanations,explanations>> first.

[#_using_explanations]
== Using explanations

Explanations can only be enabled when inference is on.

To use explanations with TypeDB Studio:

. Enable inference (<<_using_inference,See above>>).
. Toggle on the `snapshot` and then `explain` buttons in the top toolbar.
. Run a *Get query* that uses inference.
. Double-click on any inferred result (they are highlighted with green outline).
