TypeQL is a declarative query language used by TypeDB.

== Fully-declarative

Rather than writing an algorithm of how the data should be retrieved, we declare requirements, and the TypeDB query
processor will take care of finding an optimal way to retrieve and process the data.

TypeQL is both a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language[Data Definition Language,window=_blank] (DDL)
and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language[Data Manipulation Language,window=_blank] (DML).

== Schema and data manipulation

As a DDL, it lets us define a <<_schema,schema>> of a database.

As a DML, it lets us query (read&write) <<_data,data>> of a database.

== Syntax and grammar

The complete set of the TypeQL grammar can be seen in the *ANTLR v.4* specification file:
