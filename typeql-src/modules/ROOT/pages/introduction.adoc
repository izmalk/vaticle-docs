TypeQL is a declarative query language used by TypeDB.

== Strongly typed

All queries are validated with type hierarchy, defined in a schema.

== Fully-declarative

Rather than writing an algorithm of how the data should be retrieved, we declare requirements, and the TypeDB query
processor will take care of finding an optimal way to retrieve and process the data.

== Schema and data manipulation

As a DDL, TypeQL lets us define a xref:typeql::schema/overview.adoc[schema] of a database.

As a DML, TypeQL lets us query (read&write) xref:typeql::data/overview.adoc[data] of a database.

== Syntax and grammar

The complete set of the TypeQL grammar can be seen in the *ANTLR v.4* specification file:
