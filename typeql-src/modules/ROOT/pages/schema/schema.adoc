[#_schema]

TypeDB schema is like a blueprint of a database.

A database schema contains all user-defined <<_types,types>> and <<_rules,rules>> used in a database.

Every instance of data inserted in a TypeDB database must be assigned a type and be validated against constraints.

[NOTE]
====
Database schemas written in TypeQL resemble logical data models of relational databases.
TypeDB removes the need to create a separate physical data model and allows developers to create schemas that mirror
their object model, simplifying design and development.

As a result, TypeDB schemas look like entity-relationship (ER) diagrams with entities, relations, and attributes
connected by roles of relations and ownerships of attributes, but also subtyping (see <<_inheritance,inheritance>>
below).
