= Sorting

This page covers sorting of TypeQL query results.

== Behavior

By default, a TypeDB server streams query results without a specific order,
ensuring fast retrieval as solutions are sent as they're found.

To impose a specific order, you can use the `sort` keyword followed by one or multiple comma-separated query variables.
But this requires the server to find all results to make sure they are properly sorted before sending any.

You can specify ascending (asc) or descending (desc) order for each variable sorted by.
The ascending order is assumed by default.

Sorting is crucial for result reproducibility.
Without it, the order of query results isn't guaranteed in any way
and can be different every time you send the same query to the same database.

Sorting is commonly used alongside pagination.
In this case, sorting precedes pagination in TypeQL query syntax.
For example, see the xref:typeql::modifiers/pagination.adoc[] page.

== Usage

include::typeql::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

Let's see an example of sorting results of a Get query:

.Get query sorting example
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name $n;
get $n;
sort $n asc;
----

The above Get query returns sorted `full-name` attributes owned by entities of the `person` type.

For the Fetch query results sorting, you can see the example below:

.Fetch query sorting example
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name $n;
fetch $p: full-name;
sort $n asc;
----

The above Fetch query returns sorted `full-name` attributes owned by entities of the `person` type.
Notice that there is no `$n` variable in the `fetch` clause of this query.
Sorting is performed on the results of the `match` clause,
so `fetch` clause determines only what data is projected into JSONs.
In this case, we are projecting all attributes of the `full-name` type owned by the `$p` already.
Adding `$n` to the `fetch` clause is possible, but redundant in this case.
