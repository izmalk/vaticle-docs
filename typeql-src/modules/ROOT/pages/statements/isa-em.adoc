= isa!

The `isa` keyword is used in TypeQL statements to specify a direct type for a data instance.

== Syntax

The most common syntax construction is:

.Syntax
[,typeql]
----
<data-instance> isa! <type>
----

Where `data-instance` can be a concept variable representing a data instance, a literal value representing an attribute,
or both; `type` can be a type label or a concept variable representing a type.


== Type manipulation example

match
$x isa! $type, has full-name "Bob";
insert
$y isa $type, has full-name "Just-like-Bob";
