# Java TypeDB Driver overview

Java Driver was developed by Vaticle to enable TypeDB support for Java software and developers.

For exact installation instructions — see the [installation ](02-java-install.md) page.

Explore the Java Driver [tutorial](03-java-tutorial.md) with example of connecting to TypeDB.

Use the [API reference](04-java-api-ref.md) page for documentation of the methods and objects used in the Driver.

Learn to use native Java syntax to build TypeQL queries with [Java query builder](05-java-query-builder.md).
